# VegaConflict-bot
A bot to find the tagged ship types, attack them, repair your fleet and do it all over again

To run the program, open vega conflict, then switch back to the script. Start the script and within the next 2 seconds switch to vega conflict and it will run fine.

The script selects your desired fleet and then sends them to whatever ship type you have flagged, attacks it and when the AI combat is done, repairs your fleet. 
To change the fleet you wish to attack simply tag another ship type within the game.
Presss 'f9' if you wish to stop the script.

NOTE!
The bot uses raw coordinates to press some buttons so on places where it does that it would be smart to double check if they're right for you
