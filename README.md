# VegaConflict-bot
A bot to find the tagged ship types, attack them, repair your fleet and do it all over again

To run the program, open vega conflict, then switch back to the script. Start the script and within the next 2 seconds switch to vega conflict, and it will run fine.

The script selects your [idle fleet][1] and then sends them to fight whatever ship type you have flagged. 
The fleet will do a fixed number of combat before going back home.
If a fleet need reparation the bot will repair your flet, if it's free, otherwise it will send them back home.
You can press 'q' if you wish to stop the script.

## Note:
The bot uses the image from the bank to press some button so remember to adapt them to your screen size.
